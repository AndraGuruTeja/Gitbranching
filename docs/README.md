# Project Documentation

This project is for practicing Git branching and DevOps workflows.

## Task Tracking
All tasks and steps for the DevOps project are documented here using markdown for clarity and collaboration.

### Example Task Documentation

#### Task: Initialize Repository
- Run `git init` in your project directory.
- Create a remote repository on GitHub and link it.

#### Task: Create Branches
- Create `main`, `dev`, and `feature` branches as described in the main README.

#### Task: Use Pull Requests
- Open pull requests for merging feature branches into `dev` or `main`.
- Document PRs and decisions here.

#### Task: Add .gitignore and Tags
- Add a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files.
- Tag releases and document them here.

## Workflow Example
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repo-url>`
2. Checkout the `dev` branch: `git checkout dev`
3. Create a new feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>`
4. Make changes, commit, and push: `git add . && git commit -m "<message>" && git push origin feature/<feature-name>`
5. Open a pull request on GitHub.
6. Document the process and decisions in this file.

## Markdown Usage
- Use headings, lists, and code blocks for clear documentation.
- Update this file with every major change or decision.
